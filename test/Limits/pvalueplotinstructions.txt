To produce that with combine what you have to do is:

- for each value X of the cross-section that you're considering
  - run the HybridNew method with

     --rule=CLsplusb --singlePoint X --saveHybridResult --clsAcc=0 -T <toys-per-run> -i <runs>

        to probe a CLs+b of 10^-5 you need at least 10^5 toys in
total, but you can do it in parallel in multiple jobs with different
random seed, and merge the output files with "hadd".
        the default number of toys per run is 500, which is ok for
simple models, but if your model is very complex, something like 100
or 50 is better (there are memory leaks that get cleaned up only once
per run)

  - then you can get the observed CL_{s+b} from the output of before with

        combine ... --rule=CLsplusb --singlePoint <X> --readHybridResult --toysFile=<somefile.root>

  - then you can get quantiles of the expected distribution: 0.5 gives
you the median, 0.16 and 0.84 the edges of the 68% band and so on

        combine ... --rule=CLsplusb --singlePoint <X> --readHybridResult --toysFile=<somefile.root> --expectedFromGrid <quantile>
