TO GENERATE THE DATACARDS:
1. If muon/electron histograms are not yet combined and you want to combine them,
   run superPlot("sumsig.cfg") to sum electron/muon contributions, create new file
2. edit "mjjinputs.h" for changes in channel definitions, lumi update, whscale factor, etc.,
   as well as the list of files pointing the code to the right histograms to use.
3. Run mjjshapes(). This prepares the root file that contains the shapes referred to in
   the data cards, with proper histogram naming, including the generic signal shapes.
4. prepare systematic lines to be used in each datacard in file mjjsystall.txt with
   a text editor.
5. run ./mkcards.sh to make the datacards from the rootfiles
6. OLD: (run ./combinecards.sh to make the combined 2jet+3jet datacards - now obsolete)

TO GENERATE THE BAR PLOT:
OLD:
	1. ./combine_obs_mjj.sh ${THISDIR}/datacard*.txt and
	   ./combine_exp_mjj.sh ${THISDIR}/datacard*.txt
	2. run ./parseObs.sh limitobs*.log and
	       ./parse.sh    limitexp*.log to generate exp/obs tables
	3. run "join -t '	' ..." on the tables to make one table (e.g., "tablename.tab")
NEW
	1. ./combine_asymp_mjj.sh ${THISDIR}/datacard*txt # runs asymptotic method, does both obs/exp
	2. run ./mjjparseAsym.sh limit*log >mytable.txt
	3. edit resulting table if necessary (move WH to the last row, otherwise Zprime
           usually falls off the end of the plot)
	4. root> .L plotMjjLimitBars.C+;  plotMjjLimitBars("mytable.txt") to plot the limit plot

TO GENERATE THE P-VALUE PLOT:

1. Adjust the parameters in mjj_makeGrid.sh for the cross-section coverage,
   sensitivity, granularity, and how many jobs to run
2. Run cd ..; ./mjj_makeGrid.sh ${THISDIR}/datacard*.txt on the datacard(s) of
   interest. For the p-value plot, this should just be a single datacard with
   the generic gaussian signal in it, "datacard_gs.txt". This creates the crab
   cfg file, script ('.sh') file, and root workspace.
3. Run crab -cfg <crab.cfg file> -create -submit
4. Monitor crab jobs, collect output, "hadd" root files together.
5. Run ./mkGridOutScript.pl gs >mjj_genTable_gs.sh, which makes the script that
   collects the obs/exp statistics from the combined crab output.
6. Run ./mjj_genTable_gs.sh >table.txt. Edit table.txt removing uncertainties
   and putting in tabular form.
7. In root, run
   root> .L plotMjjPvalues.C+
   root> plotMjjPvalues("table.txt")
